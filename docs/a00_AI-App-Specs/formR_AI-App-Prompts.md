**Usage Instructions:**
To execute these prompts sequentially, tell me to "run formR_AI-App-Prompts.md"
You will process each prompt one at a time, waiting for confirmation for each one.
Each prompt asks you to use a markdown file as the specs for a client and server app, e.g. c01 or s01.  
Please process it fully before going on to the next prompt.
If you see that you have already created a client and server folder for the app. skip to the next one.
If you don't get a confirmation, i.e. yes, then skip to the next prompt.
